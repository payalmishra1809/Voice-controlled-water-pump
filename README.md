# Voice-controlled-water-pump
A simple and effective Arduino-based system that uses the Elechouse Voice Recognition V3 module to control a water pump via voice commands like “Pump ON” and “Pump OFF”. This project demonstrates how voice input can be used for home automation, especially useful in agricultural or domestic settings.
